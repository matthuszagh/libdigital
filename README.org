* About
libdigital is a personal collection of FPGA (and ASIC?) cores as well
as a number of useful scripts for designing digital circuits. The
implementations are currently done in Verilog, but in the future I
intend to port them to nMigen.

* TODO
** Use inferrence for FIR multiply
** Incorporate resource usage reports into unit tests
This relates to the next item, since edalize will probably support
this functionality at a nearterm date.

** Consider using edalize as an abstraction interface
Among other things (such as?) this could be used to automatically
check resource usage and incorporate this information into into
automated testing. For instance, some HDL change causes a module to
stop inferring block RAM in some architectures.
